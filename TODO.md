# Make sure we capture:

Minimum
    The smallest value in a sample data set.
Maximum
    The largest value in a sample data set.
Range
    The range from the minimum to the maximum;
    range = max - min
Sum
    The total of all data values.
    (x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn)
Count (n)
    The total number of data values in a data set.
Mean
    The sum of all of the data divided by the count; the average;
    mean = sum / n.
Median
    The numeric value separating the higher half of the ordered sample data from the lower half. If n is odd the median is the center value.  If n is even the median is the average of the 2 center values.


Mode
    The value or values that occur most frequently in the data set.
Standard Deviation (s)
    The square root of the variance;
    2√variance or variance = s2
Variance
    The sum of the squared differences between data values and the mean, divided by the count - 1;
    [ (x1 - mean)2 + (x2 - mean)2 + (x3 - mean)2 + ... + (xn - mean)2 ] / [n - 1]
Midrange
    The average of the minimum and maximum of the data set. (min + max)/2
Quartiles
    The median is the second quartile Q2. It divides the ordered data set into higher and lower halves.  The first quartile, Q1, is the median of the lower half not including Q2. The third quartile, Q3, is the median of the higher half not including Q2.  This is 1 of several methods for calculating the quartiles.[1]
Interquartile Range
    The range from Q1 to Q3 is the interquartile range (IQR).
    [Q3 - Q1]
Sum of Squares
    The sum of the squared differences between data values and the mean;
    [ (x1 - mean)2 + (x2 - mean)2 + (x3 - mean)2 + ... + (xn - mean)2 ]
Mean Deviation (Mean Absolute Deviation)[2]
    The sum of the differences between data values and the mean, divided by the count;
    [ (x1 - mean) + (x2 - mean) + (x3 - mean) + ... + (xn - mean) ] / n
Root Mean Square (RMS)
    The square root of, the sum of the squared data values divided by n
    2√[ (x12 + x22 + x32 + ... + xn2) / n ]
Standard Error of the Mean
    The standard deviation divided by the square root of the count;
    s / 2√n
Skewness[3]
    The sum of the cubed differences between data values and the mean, divided by the count minus 1 times the cubed standard deviation;
    [ (x1 - mean)3 + (x2 - mean)3 + (x3 - mean)3 + ... + (xn - mean)3 ] / [ (n - 1) * s3 ]
Kurtosis[3]
    The sum of the fourth power of differences between data values and the mean, divided by the count minus 1 times the fourth power of the standard standard deviation;
    [ (x1 - mean)4 + (x2 - mean)4 + (x3 - mean)4 + ... + (xn - mean)4 ] / [ (n - 1) * s4 ]
Coefficient of Variation
    The standard deviation divided by the mean;
    s / mean
Relative Standard Deviation (expressed as a percentage)
    100 times the standard deviation divided by the mean;
    (100 * s / mean)%
Frequency
    The number of occurrences for each data value in the data set.
